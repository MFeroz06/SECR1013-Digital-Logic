## Introduction
### Deeds Simulator
- The Digital Circuit Simulator **d-DcS** appears to the user as a graphical schematic editor, with a library of simplified logic components, specialized toward pedagogical needs and not describing specific commercial products.
- As described before, the schematic editor allows building a simple digital networks composed of gates, flip-flops, pre-defined combinational and sequential circuits and custom-defined components (defined as Finite state machine). 
- Simulation can be interactive or in timing-mode. In the first mode, the student can "animate" the digital system in the editor, controlling its inputs and observing the results. This is the simplest mode to examine a digital network, and this way of operation can be useful for the beginners. In the timing mode, the behavior of the circuit can be analyzed by a timing diagram window, in which the user can define graphically an input signal sequence and observe the simulation results.
