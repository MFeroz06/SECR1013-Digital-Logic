# Lab 1 : Combinational Logic
## Introduction
---
- Two hours per week are allocated for laboratory session in Digital Logic. All laboratory experiments are marked and contributed to 10% of the overall mark for the course.
  - Students must attend all scheduled laboratory sessions. 
  - Students are required to be punctual – latecomers may be refused entry. 
  - Pre-lab questions must be answered prior to the laboratory session. 
  - Answer all questions in the sections of the laboratory manual. 
- Here are some guidelines to help you perform the experiments: 
  - Read all instructions carefully and carry them all out. 
  - Ask the demonstrator if you are unsure of anything. 
x Don't depend on the Digital kit settings, always measure! 
x Record actual results (comment on them if they are unexpected!) 
x If required, write up full and suitable conclusions for each 
experiment. 
x If student have any doubt about the safety of any procedure, contact 
the demonstrator beforehand. 
x THINK about what you are doing! 
Most experiments involve the use of the Digital kit and your breadboard.
