## Introduction
---
- This lab focuses on several practical issues related to bread boarding and testing combinational logic circuits. Several helpful points are made below.
- **Wire gauge** - Use only 22 gauge wire. The breadboard may be damaged by forcing smaller gauge (larger diameter) wire into the holes.
- **Wire color** - Use organized color schemes when wiring circuits. For example, use RED wire for all Vcc connections, BLACK wire for all ground connections, BLUE wire for all input switches, and YELLOW wire for all intermediate signal connections.
- **Wire length and placement** - Use wires that are the appropriate length so that they can lie flat on the breadboard. Avoid running wires over IC’s in case the IC’s need to be removed.
- **Testing IC’s** - Chip tester is available in lab, always check your IC’s before you begin wiring the circuit.
- **Inserting IC’s** - IC’s are not difficult to insert in the socket strips once they have been properly adjusted. Brand new IC’s are shipped with their pins bent apart from the vertical (typically 15 outward) in order to facilitate handling by automatic insertion equipment. Therefore, before an IC is used for the first time its pins must be bent back so that their spacing is vertical. 
- **IC Orientation** - Arrange all IC’s in the same direction. This will facilitate connecting Vcc on each IC to a 5V strip on the breadboard and GND on each IC to a ground strip. If an IC is reversed (thus Vcc and ground are reversed), it may be destroyed. It is recommended that you begin wiring by making all Vcc and ground connections. 
- **IC Removal** - It is recommended that you use some sort of extraction tool for removing IC’s. Attempts to remove IC’s by hand may result in bent pins.
- **Monitoring the logic level of the circuit**
  - Use the LED (at the top right of the digital kit) to monitor the logic level of the digital circuit.
  - A GREEN indicates that the logic level is LOW (0) and a RED means the logic level is HIGH (1).
  - If the LED does not lit, there is something wrong with the circuit.
  -  Switch off the power supply and recheck the circuit.
  -  Note: Please be certain that the MODE switch is flip to TTL not CMOS.
  -  You can use a logic probe (at the bottom right of the digital circuit) to monitor the logic level of any node (point) of the circuit.
  -   H indicates logic HIGH (1), L means LOW (0) and P means pulse (the signal keeps on changing between HIGH and LOW). 
- **Switches** 
  - There are 8 toggle switches at the bottom row of the digital circuit. These switches will provide a logic input of HIGH (1) and LOW (0) to the circuit.
